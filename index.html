            Over the past three-and-a-half years that I have attended the University of Toronto, I've gotten to experience a wide variety of amazing food, especially close to school. Many of these restaurants have become very near and dear to my heart and I always look forward to sharing it with my friends when they come to visit. <br>
            <br>
            This summer, I will be graduating from U of T, which means that for the first time since I started in 2019, my entire family will be visiting from my hometown. On top of that, my best friend will also be visiting. As such, I have a lot of opportunities to share my favourite restaurants! This map shows all the different places I have come to love near U of T.

            Because I take public transit exclusively and do not drive in Toronto, I have included all the transit around the university. In addition, I was curious to know how the accessibility of the area might change with the addition of future subway lines, such as the Ontario Line, so I included some infrastructure that hasn't been completed yet.
