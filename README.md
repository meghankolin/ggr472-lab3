 A map of restaurants near U of T

In this map, I have included several restaurants near the University of Toronto in the form of a GeoJSON file, as well as some vector data that shows transit lines near the school. I also created a basemap using a personal photo in Mapbox.

The JavaScript file includes zoom and navigation controls, as well as code that allows the user to click on the restaurants and find their address. In addition, users can re-centre the map using an HTML button and the dots showing the locations of the restaurants scale with the zoom level.
